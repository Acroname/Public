AcronisBackupExample Readme
===============================================================================

This is a basic C++ example for how to use an Acroname 8 Port Programmable USB hub 
with Acronis backup software to keep rotating backups offline. When executed, 
this example disables each downstream device port on the hub,
and then re-enables one based on the day of the week. If run with the argument "post" this 
program will disable all ports to keep backups offline.

This is companion code to an Acroname blog post at
